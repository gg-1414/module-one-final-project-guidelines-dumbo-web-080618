##### SELF CARDS #####
Card.create(category: "self", name: "The Wheel Of Fortune", saying:
"It could be hard to sit still today and every little distraction
may look more like an invitation to take a break or start the next thing.
Get a lot done anyway by concentrating on short tasks and short conversations.")
Card.create(category: "self", name: "The Sun", saying:
"You don’t always have this much energy, motivation, and vitality.
Make the most of today, do a good job with whatever is normally on your plate,
and then tackle something that touches your heart and makes your spirit sing.")
Card.create(category: "self", name: "The Magician", saying:
"Be organized, stick to your personal routine, and don’t gloss over any
steps if you want to get the results you have in mind. This could be a day
better for practice than for performance.")
Card.create(category: "self", name: "The Emperor", saying:
"You’ll need determination and perseverance to accomplish anything of substance
today. Pick something (or accept something that has been assigned to you) and
stick with it until day’s end.")
Card.create(category: "self", name: "The Hanged Man", saying:
"Everybody falls victim to a misjudgment or a faulty calculation sometimes,
so don’t let that be a reason to grind to a halt and stop working on what
matters to you. Sometimes deception is involved, but that does not free you
from the obligation to try and set things right.")

##### LOVE CARDS #####
Card.create(category: "love", name: "The High Priestess", saying:
"The High Priestess urges you to let your intuition be your guide today.
Cupid’s arrow follows the same path as your subconscious, and you’re sure
to hit a romantic bull’s-eye when you trust your instincts. Love at first
sight is not only possible, but it’s probable.")
Card.create(category: "love", name: "The Hermit", saying:
"Are your dreams trying to tell you something important? The Hermit
stands alone and reaches deep within himself to find the answers he is
looking for, and he tells you to pay close attention to symbols that
appear in your dreams via your subconscious.")
Card.create(category: "love", name: "The Sun", saying:
"Can you feel the warmth spreading across your face? The Sun card is
representative of joy and exuberance, which means your enthusiasm for a
current or potential love connection is well-placed.")
Card.create(category: "love", name: "The Fool", saying:
"You’re learning, but you’re just not quite there yet. The Fool signifies
inexperience and, of course, a certain amount of foolishness when it comes
to love. Even if you’ve been around the block a time or two, there is still
plenty for you to learn.")
Card.create(category: "love", name: "Strength", saying:
"You have the self-confidence and determination to pull off whatever romantic
escapades you have planned. The Strength card illustrates that you have
expertly-gained knowledge and self-discipline in your corner, and as long as
you’re adequately prepared for what lies ahead, what can go wrong?")

##### CAREER CARDS #####
Card.create(category: "career", name: "The Magician", saying:
"You have the opportunity to show the world how talented you are. Drawing
this card suggests you’re about to attend a meeting or are hoping to prove
you’re the person for that lucrative contract or fabulous promotion.")
Card.create(category: "career", name: "Temperance", saying:
"If you’ve been thinking about a business partnership or collaborating on a
project, this card comes to let you know that with the right person you can make
magic. You’ll likely know when you have met them as you’ll notice the chemistry
between you right off the bat.")
Card.create(category: "career", name: "The World", saying:
"It’s time to take center stage and show the world what you can do. If you’ve
invested a lot of energy into your business or career pursuits, then the ability
to market yourself in the right way may be crucial to your success.")
Card.create(category: "career", name: "The Hanged Man", saying:
"Drawing this card can indicate a period when nothing much seems to be happening.
It might even appear that your career progress or job search has come to a halt,
leaving you frazzled or bored. Try not to fight this, as the first stirrings of
positive change will show up in their own time.")
Card.create(category: "career", name: "The Tower", saying:
"If you’ve set your heart on that dream job or lucrative contract, there’s a
chance it won’t materialize in the way you hope. The thing here is not to let
any sense of failure get to you. If it doesn’t work out there’s a good chance it
wasn’t quite right for you, and that this has happened for the best.")

##### FUTURE CARDS #####
Card.create(category: "future", name: "Eight Of Swords", saying:
"In the future, a difficult situation will arise. It may take awhile to figure
out how to deal with this situation, and in the meantime you may feel uncomfortable.
You may feel grief and anxiety. However, eventually you will be illuminated, and you
will be surprised by how easily the right action sets you free of the bindings that
were holding you back.")
Card.create(category: "future", name: "Judgement", saying:

from someone or what someone is hiding from you. Perhaps you are in denial, and the true consequences will come to light. Ultimately, this will bring you a feeling of reilef.")
Card.create(category: "future", name: "The High Priestess", saying:
"In the future, there will come a time when you need to withdraw and consider carefully
how you expend your energies. There may be people who want to take advantage of your
good will, beauty, or intelligence. You will need to find a way to continue to nourish
yourself and those you can surely trust while pulling back from anyone who could be a threat.")
Card.create(category: "future", name: "The Fool", saying:
"In the future, you will find a way to be free of self-judgement and the judgement of othes.
You will be able to direct the course of your own life in a way that makes you feel free.
You will not be satisfied with anything that diminshes the beauty of earth or that disrespects humanity.")
Card.create(category: "future", name: "Two Of Wands", saying:
"In the future, you will establish a healthy relationship between yourself and your community.
You will find a balance between your needs and those of others. You will feel independent yet connected in valuable partnerships and groups and learn how to avoid overextending yourself to please others without becoming selfish.")
